                        <p>Two years ago, I accepted an interview invitation in this small town, in the north of France. 
                        It was a bright, sunny day and it was my first time I was exploring alone a city in a <b>foreign</b> country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being eager to find out more about foreign cultures, I thought that
                            this would be a good chance to improve my foreign language skills and to travel. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It is said that speaking a foreign language not only facilitates 
                        communication with the people from a different culture, but it also gives
                        you a different perspective on your own thought process, a new light on 
                        everything that you already know. And this transforms you.
                        </p>
